<h2>Introduction </h2>
<p>
  <strong> Redwood </strong> is an opinionated, full-stack, serverless web application framework that will allow you to build and deploy JAMstack applications with ease. A Redwood Jamstack can be thoughy like a React Framework, statically delivered by CDN, that communicates vio GraphQL to our backend running on AWS Lambdas around the world, all deployable with just a <strong> git push </strong>.  
  
The main three important concepts for Redwood Framework are:
  <ul>
    <li>ReactJs  </li>
    <li>Graph  </li>
    <li>The JamStack  </li>
</ul>  
 
React is an Javascript library for building user Interfaces and reusable UI components. React is a library
for building composable user interface.React abstracts away the DOM from you, offering a simpler programming model and better performance. The main features of ReactJs are <strong>JSX,Components,virtual DOM,usable for both server side and client side</strong>
 
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing dat. Graphql provides a complete and understable description of the data in our API, giving client the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

Jamstack is an architecture designed to make the web faster, more secure, and easier to scale. It builds onmany of the tools and workflows which developers love and which brings maximum productivity. The core principle of pre-rendering and decoupling enables sites and applications to be delivered with greater confidence and resilience than ever before.
